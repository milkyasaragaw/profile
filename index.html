            <h3>Design and Development</h3>
            <p>As a full stack developer, I have wealth of experiance on developing both client and server software. 
                Now, contrary to what a lot of people think, “full stack” doesn’t necessarily mean a developer is writing all of a site’s code themselves. 
                Many full stack web developers spend the majority of their time in either the front or back end code of a site.
            </p>
            <p>But the point is that they know enough about the code across the entire stack that they can dive in anywhere if needed. 
                 And some full stack developers do code entire websites, including both the front and back ends, 
                 but usually only if they are working freelance or are the only developer working on a project.
            </p>
            <p> 
                My skills as a Full Stack Developer are  
                <ul>
                    <li>Program a browser (using HTML,CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue)</li>
                    <li>Program a server (using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)</li>
                    <li>Program a database (using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB)</li>
                </ul>                                 
            </p>   
                
            
          </div>

            <h3>Network and Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>Am a professional who is highly skilled on maintaining the connectivity of networks in terms of data, voice, calls, videos and wireless network services. 
                <I></I> was and still accountable for formulating, implementing and executing the entirety of computer networks within an organization.
                I am making sure all the systems are functioning properly as intended. 
                My fundamental goal is to provide maximum network infrastructure, security and performance to the end users.
                I always proves cost-effective for the organization while also meeting needs for users and the business.

            </p>
            <p>
